			  <p>Water comes from one of two sources:  surface water or groundwater.  Streams
			  and their associated watersheds, lakes and reservoirs comprise the surface water network.  Groundwater exists in aquifers.  Aquifers 
			  consist of permeable rock or materials such as gravel, sand or silt that can contain or transmit water.  Groundwater 
			  often exists in shallow alluvial aquifers that return the water to streams underground, but this can take months or years.  
			  Some groundwater can filter into deeper aquifers and remain there for thousands of years.  Groundwater is 
              available for use via wells or springs.</p>			  
              <p>The predominant water source for Coloradans is surface water from snowmelt, rain and surface 
			  water reservoirs that release stored water.</p>
              <p>The following is a concise summary of the surface water network of the South Platte Basin 
			  (<a href="https://www.watereducationcolorado.org/news-and-publications/citizen-guides/citizens-guide-to-where-your-water-comes-from/" target="_blank">Citizen's

			  <p><i>"The headwaters of the South Platte River are formed by the combination of several smaller rivers--the north, 
			  middle and south forks...The north fork of the river originates in the peaks around Mt. Evans while the south fork 
			  originates in the South Park area.  In South Park, the south fork is impounded by multiple reservoirs:  Antero, 
			  Spinney Mountain and Eleven Mile Canyon.  It drops many feet in elevation before exiting the mountains and flowing 
			  into Cheesman Reservoir.  The South Platte then makes its way through Denver to Greeley, where it travels northeast 
			  to its confluence with the North Platte River at North Platte, Nebraska...Many substantial tributaries feed the 
			  South Platte.  North to south, these include the Cache la Poudre, Big Thompson, St. Vrain, Boulder Creek, Clear Creek, 
			  Tarryall Creek, Cherry Creek, Sand Creek and others.  In the lower South Platte, many off-channel reservoirs store 
			  water diverted from the river so that it can be used at a later time.  These include:  Barr Lake, Riverside, Empire, 
			  Sterling, and Julesburg reservoirs."</i></p>

			  Citizen's Guide to Colorado Water Law<img src="images/baseline_launch_white_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>.
			  <p>The Colorado Doctrine is a set of laws regarding water use and land ownership, adopted by Coloradans in the 1860s.  
			  One of its essential principles is that water is a public resource and can be used for beneficial use by public agencies, 
			  private persons and entities.  Beneficial uses include uses for municipal water supply, agriculture, industry and 
			  recreation, among others.</p>
			  <p>A legal framework called the prior appropriation doctrine regulates the use of surface water and tributary groundwater 
			  that is connected to streams.  This doctrine is also referred to by the phrase "first in time, first in right".  This means 
			  that in times of short water supply, court-decreed water rights holders who obtained their rights earlier (senior rights) 
			  can use water before decreed rights with later dates (junior rights) may use any remaining water.  The water user must 
			  have a definite plan to divert, store or otherwise capture, possess and control water, and must specify the place of 
			  diversion or storage, amount of water, type of use and place of use.  Water is administered by the 
			  <a href="http://water.state.co.us/Home/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Colorado Division of Water Resources<img src="images/baseline_launch_white_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>.</p>
              <p>Water rights holders are typically organizations such as municipal utilities, ditch companies, natural resource 
              organizations or industries, although individuals can also own water rights.  The costs for water rights are passed 
			  on to water users.  For example, utility customers or farmers in a ditch company pay for the delivery of water and 
			  those payments cover the costs of acquiring water and the infrastructure to deliver the water.</p>
			  <p>Another important beneficial use of water in Colorado is to keep the water in the stream.  The 
			  <a href="http://cwcb.state.co.us/environment/instream-flow-program/Pages/main.aspx" target="_blank">Colorado Water 
			  Conservation Board<img src="images/baseline_launch_white_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a> is legally permitted under state law to make instream flow appropriations.  These are meant 
			  to assist in preserving the natural environment to a reasonable degree by ensuring and enhancing minimum flows.  However, these 
			  instream flow rights typically are junior rights.</p>

              <h2>Water Use Concepts</h2>			  
			  <p>Many entities compete for Colorado's water resources for various uses.  These entities need water at different times 
			  of the year.  Streams have peak runoff flows from snow melt in May and June; to capture this water, 
			  storage water rights are obtained that allow for the storage of water in reservoirs until the water is needed.  For 
			  example, agricultural demand for water is typically only from May to October.  Municipal water demand is fairly constant 
			  throughout the year for indoor use but greatly increases for outdoor use in the summer months to water 
			  landscaping.  Environmental and recreational flow requirements vary by species and recreational activity.  The graphic at right 
			  (from Headwaters Magazine, <a href="http://efdsystems.org/pdf/Headwaters_-_The_Energy_Issure_Fall_2013.pdf" target="_blank">The 
			  Energy Issue<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, p.12) shows statewide water withdrawals.</p>
			  <p>Of primary interest is the consumptive use of water.  Consumptive use is the amount of water that is permanently 
			  withdrawn from its source because it has evaporated, has been transpired by plants, incorporated into crops or it is 
			  directly consumed by people, livestock and industries.  Water that is diverted for municipal, industrial or agricultural purposes 
			  that is not consumed returns to rivers and/or aquifers by surface flows or underground flows.  These surface and 
			  underground flows are collectively called return flows and can be used by downstream water users.  Water that is diverted 
			  from other basins, such as the Colorado River, can be 100% consumed.  Specific requirements may be in place for certain 
			  transbasin diversions.  For example, Colorado-Big Thompson (C-BT) transbasin diversions are single-use; this ensures that entities 
			  in the Northern Water (the administrator of C-BT water) service area benefit from return flows.</p>  
			  <p>Statewide, 89% of consumed water goes to agriculture, 7% goes to municipalities and about 
			  4% goes to large industries (<a href="https://www.watereducationcolorado.org/news-and-publications/citizen-guides/citizens-guide-to-colorado-water-conservation/" target="_blank">Citizen's 
			  Guide to Colorado Water Conservation<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, p.3).  Note that this is consumed water, not total water withdrawals as shown in 
			  the graphic at right.  Withdrawals are generally equivalent to diversions.</p>
			  <p>However, while agriculture consumes the most water, the U.S. Geological Survey has estimated 
			  that approximately only 37% of the water diverted statewide for agriculture is actually consumed 
			  (<a href="https://www.watereducationcolorado.org/news-and-publications/citizen-guides/citizens-guide-to-where-your-water-comes-from/" target="_blank">Citizen's 
			  Guide to Where Your Water Comes From<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, p.12). Irrigation return flows are often reused multiple times.  Because of this repeated reuse 
			  of water, the annual diversions in a river basin can be multiple times the natural water supply.</p> 
			  <p>A water right that was originally decreed for one use, such as agriculture, can be transferred to other uses, such as 
			  municipal supply.  In this case, the consumptive portion of a water right can be transferred and historical return flow 
			  patterns must generally be maintained. Some storage is typically required to assure timing.  Transbasin diversions that 
			  are returned from wastewater treatment plants are also an important source of water to meet requirements.</p>
			  <p>Pumping of alluvial groundwater for urban and agricultural uses can remove water from the river and leave senior 
			  surface water users with less water than they had previously.  In these situations, engineering plans called 
			  "augmentation plans" are required to ensure that water extracted from groundwater wells does not unfairly take water 
              from surface water users or senior well users.  These plans must be approved in a water court.  Permits for new wells 
              are frequently denied unless they also contain an augmentation plan (<a href="https://www.watereducationcolorado.org/news-and-publications/citizen-guides/citizens-guide-to-where-your-water-comes-from/" target="_blank">Citizen's

              <h2>Municipalities</h2>
              <p>There are 117 municipalities in the South Platte and Metro Basin.  Collectively, the South Platte and Metro Basin is the most populous basin in 
			  Colorado.  Approximately 85% of Colorado's population resides in the Basin.  By 2050, the Basin's population may nearly double from 
			  approximately 3.5 million people to 6 million people (CWP, p.3-12).</p>  
              <p>The 10 largest cities in the Basin, based on 2016 population data, from largest to smallest, are:  Denver, Aurora, Fort Collins, 
			  Lakewood, Thornton, Arvada, Westminster, Centennial, Boulder and Greeley (see next page for population numbers).  Each contains over 
			  100,000 people.  Except for Colorado Springs and Pueblo, these are also the largest cities in the State (Colorado Springs is the 
			  second largest city; Pueblo is the ninth largest).</p>
			  <p>In this map, municipalities are color-coded by 2016 population and sized by the percent change in population from 2006 to 2016.  
			  The greatest percentage changes in population since 2006 are those municipalities in the northern Front Range and include Firestone, Frederick, 
			  Johnstown, Mead, Severance, Timnath, Wellington and Windsor.  These municipalities may have undeveloped water supplies (own water rights 
			  but have not used them) or may seek new supplies from various sources.</p>

              <h2>Population Projections to 2050</h2>
			  <p>Population growth is the single largest driver of the need for additional water supplies in the South Platte River Basin (BIP, p.1-17).  
			  Water providers and agencies typically plan for water demand and supply using a long lead time because of long timelines for project implementation.</p>
			  <p>The Department of Local Affairs (DOLA)'s <a href="https://demography.dola.colorado.gov/" target="_blank">State Demography Office<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a> provides 
			  population projections to the year 2050 for each of Colorado's counties.  This choropleth map shows county populations for the years 2018 to 2050.

			  <p>As part of the Colorado Water Plan, five planning scenarios were developed that represent how the State's alternative water futures may look in 2050.  The 
			  scenarios are based on drivers such as population, land use, climate predictions, social values, etc., and are intended to bracket possible growth scenarios.  
			  These scenarios are described briefly below in terms of how population may affect water supplies 
			  (<a href="http://cwcbweblink.state.co.us/WebLink/ElectronicFile.aspx?docid=199504&searchid=80d50cb3-95bf-405c-bfa5-587c633c7136&dbid=0" 
			  target="_blank">Colorado Water Plan<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, p.6-7).</p>
			  <ul>
			    <li><b>Hot Growth</b> - the economy is thriving, which fuels development.  A warming climate draws people to relatively cool Colorado and communities struggle to provide 
				needed services.  Families seek low-density housing and rural mountain living, resulting in rapid development of open lands.</li>
				<li><b>Adaptive Innovation</b> - again, the economy is thriving, and the warm climate draws people to a relatively cool Colorado.  But in this scenario, high-density 
				housing predominates and strong investments in research lead to greater efficiencies in water use.</li>
				<li><b>Business As Usual</b> - the economy grows slowly with anticipated spikes and falls and most Coloradans live in single-family homes.  Water conservation has 
				slowly increased.</li>
				<li><b>Cooperative Growth</b> - population growth is concentrated in cities and resort communities and water and energy conservation measures are willingly adopted.</li>
				<li><b>Weak Economy</b> - the economy struggles in Colorado and the nation as a whole; population growth is less than expected.</li>

			  <p>How a municipality collects, stores, treats and distributes water to its customers can be a complex process.  
			  If this also includes the use of transbasin water (water diverted from watersheds west of the Continental Divide to the South Platte Basin), 
			  then this process becomes even more complicated.</p>
			  <p>For example, Denver Water, the municipal water provider for the City and County of Denver serving many communities, 
			  collects and stores its water in a complex system.  The primary water sources are the South Platte and Blue rivers.  Secondary water sources include 
			  the Fraser River, Williams Fork River, South Boulder Creek, Ralston Creek and Bear Creek.  The water is stored in 13 main reservoirs.  The largest 
			  is Dillon Reservoir with 254,036 acre-feet of active capacity, followed by Eleven Mile Canyon (97,779 acre-feet), Cheesman (79,064 acre-feet) and Gross 
			  (41,811 acre-feet) reservoirs.  Additional reservoirs include Antero, Marston, Ralston, Strontia Springs, Long Lakes, Platte Canyon and Soda Lakes.  
			  Williams Fork and Wolford Mountain reservoirs are also used, primarily for water exchanges necessary to meet the needs of downstream water 
			  water rights or endangered species requirements (<a href="https://www.watereducationcolorado.org/news-and-publications/citizen-guides/citizens-guide-to-where-your-water-comes-from/" 
			  target="_blank">Citizen's Guide to Where Your Water Comes From<img src="images/baseline_launch_white_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, p.23).  Transbasin water is diverted via the Roberts Tunnel Collection System and Moffat Collection
			  System.  For more information, go to the <a href="https://www.denverwater.org/your-water/water-supply-and-planning" target="_blank">Your Water<img src="images/baseline_launch_white_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a> section of 
			  Denver Water's website.  Denver Water and other water providers typically design their systems to provide a normal water supply even in years of drought, 
			  such as a 1-in-50-year drought, with drought restrictions imposed in severe drought.</p>
			  <p>Another example, <a href="https://www.denverwater.org/your-water/water-supply-and-planning/wise" target="_blank"> WISE (Water, 
			  Infrastructure and Supply Efficiency)<img src="images/baseline_launch_white_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, is a regional partnership that provides new supply to 10 Douglas County entities by combining unused capacities in Aurora

			  Denver and Aurora.  During years that Denver and Aurora don't need all of their water supply, and when excess capacity is available in Prairie Waters, these entities 
			  can buy the unused water, which helps reduce their reliance on nonrenewable groundwater.  The 10 entities are:  Town of Castle Rock, Centennial Water and Sanitation 
			  District (WSD), Cottonwood WSD, Dominion WSD, Inverness WSD, Meridian Metropolitan District (MD), Parker WSD, Pinery Water and Wastewater District, Rangeview

              <h2>Municipal Water Providers</h2>
			  <p>Most residents of Colorado get their water via a water provider entity.  The provider may be a municipal utility, 
			  a special district, a private company or other entity type.  Municipal utilities are often organized as enterprise funds
			  that have independent budgets from the general fund of the municipality, are not-for-profit and balance rates with cost 
			  of operations and capital projects.  A <a href="https://www.sdaco.org/" target="_blank">special district<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a> is local 
			  government entity formed to serve a single purpose, such as a water and sanitation district.</p>
			  <p>Municipalities are often served by multiple water providers.  They may also have separate utilities or providers for 
			  wastewater and stormwater that have different service areas and rates.</p>
			  <p>Municipal water providers often have a water supply that comes from multiple sources, such as rivers, storage reservoirs, 
			  groundwater, transbasin diversions or reusable water.  This ensures a reliable supply when one source is not available or has 
			  a lower quality.</p>
			  <p>Municipal water providers generally have a board of directors and hold public meetings.  Water-related programs, such as 
			  conservation, agricultural water rentals and public education vary by entity type, size and relationship to other municipal programs.</p>
			  <p>Large water providers are required by federal law to annually publish a water quality annual report or "Consumer 
			  Confidence Report" (CCR).  These are often available on the water provider's website under headings related to water quality.</p>

              <h2>Municipal Water Use</h2>
			  <p> House Bill HB10-1051 was adopted by the Colorado General Assembly in 2010 and requires retail water providers that sell 2,000 acre-feet or 
			  more of water annually (termed covered entities) to report water use and conservation data on an annual basis.  The goal is to improve 
			  the quantity and quality of data available that support statewide water supply planning efforts.  The data are publicly available 
			  from the <a href="http://cowaterefficiency.com/unauthenticated_home" target="_blank">Water Efficiency Data Portal<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>.</p>
			  <p>The Colorado Water Conservation Board (CWCB) was directed to develop reporting guidelines that include descriptions of customer 
			  categories, uses and measurements.  The CWCB determined that the majority of water distribution systems could be classified as 
              Potable Treated Water, Non-Potable Raw Water and Non-Potable Reuse (or Reclaimed) Water.</p>
			  <p>Within these categories, water use is designated as distributed or metered.  Distributed water is the amount of water delivered to 
			  served customers.  Metered water is the amount of distributed water that is metered by a provider and is calculated as distributed 
			  water minus water loss (Distributed - Loss = Metered).  Water loss may occur for several reasons, including leaky pipes.</p>
			  <p>This map shows distributed potable treated water use for covered entities in the Basin for the years 2013-2017.  (Note that many of 
			  the entities have not submitted 2017 data as of the last download of this data in March 2018).  Water providers are color-coded by the population 
			  served and sized by the amount of water used.</p>
			  <p>Potable Treated water is then broken down into customer classes and categories typically include:  Residential 
			  (Single Family and Multi-Family); Utility/Municipal Facility; Commercial, Industrial and Institutional; and Irrigation Only.  
			  Additionally, Wholesale water includes water sold by the reporting entity to another entity for resale to water users (customers).  Future 
			  versions of this map may break down water use into customer classes.</p>

              <h2>Municipal Water Use and Efficiency</h2>
			  <p>Water Conservation vs. Water Efficiency:  these terms are often used interchangeably but have different meanings.  Efficiency is using the least amount 
			  of water necessary to achieve a result and focuses on reducing water waste.  Conservation is the act of increasing efficiency and refers to methods that 
			  provide permanent water savings or a reduction in the amount of water consumed.</p>
			  <p>Cities in the South Platte and Metro basins are national leaders in water conservation and reuse (BIP, p.1-17).  Municipal conservation programs have already 
			  been heavily implemented in the larger cities.  This map shows water providers that have published water efficiency plans and pop-ups provide links to those plans.  
			  According to Colorado's Water Conservation Act of 2004, water providers that deliver at least 2,000 acre-feet of water per year to their customers are 
			  required to file a water efficiency plan with the Colorado Water Conservation Board (CWCB).  The CWCB provides 
			  <a href="http://cwcb.state.co.us/LoansGrants/water-efficiency-grants/Pages/main.aspx" target="_blank">Water Efficiency Grants<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a> to 
			  eligible entities to develop water efficiency and drought plans, implement water conservation goals and educate the public about water conservation.</p>
			  <p>Water conservation is further categorized as passive or active conservation.  Passive conservation is conservation that occurs through natural trends, 
			  such as the replacement of older household fixtures (toilets, showerheads, dishwashing machines, clothes washers) with new water-efficient models.  
			  Active conservation consists of programs that proactively drive change and require a customer's participation.  These include rebates, audits and leak detection, 
              among others.  It has been estimated that 160,000 to 461,000 acre-feet of water could be saved statewide by 2050 through active municipal conservation 
			  measures and 154,000 acre-feet of water saved through passive conservation measures 
			  (<a href="https://www.watereducationcolorado.org/news-and-publications/citizen-guides/citizens-guide-to-colorado-water-conservation/" target="_blank">Citizen's

			  <p>Additional reuse of water supply components including nontributary groundwater, the consumptive use component of changed native water rights and 
			  transbasin imports is possible but may affect downstream water availability, water management flexibility and interstate water compact compliance (BIP, p.1-17).</p>

			  <p>Agriculture plays a key role in the economy of the South Platte and

			  this amounts to 40% of Colorado's irrigated acres 
			  (<a href="http://southplattebasin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/South-Platte-Basin-Implementation-Plan-April-17-2015.pdf" target="_blank">BIP<img src="images/baseline_launch_white_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, p.2-20).</p>
			  <p>In 2012, seven of the top ten agriculture-producing counties in Colorado 
			  were located in the South Platte Basin.  Agricultural sales in the Basin for that year were $5.8 billion, representing 75% of 
			  the statewide total (BIP, p.2-15).  These counties, in order of production, are:  Weld, Yuma, Morgan, Logan, Kit Carson, Washington 
			  and Phillips.</p>
			  <p>With the exception of dryland wheat, most of the agricultural production 
			  in the Basin (and the State as a whole) requires irrigation to generate sufficient crop yields.  Within the Basin, agriculture 
			  accounts for 85% of total water diversions (<a href="https://www.colorado.gov/cowaterplan" target="_blank">Colorado Water Plan<img src="images/baseline_launch_white_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, p.3-13).</p>

			   <p>This map shows the 500 ditch service areas in the Basin.  The largest, FRICO (Farmers Reservoir and Irrigation Company)/ Barr Lake Ditch, 
			   serves an area of over 100,000 acres.  Service areas are not typically fully irrigated.  Some areas within the service area may 
			   have been dried up, water rights transferred to urban use or perhaps were never irrigated because of the land use type.  Ditch service areas 
			   cover many Front Range areas that are now urbanized.  The water rights for these ditches are often transferred to municipal water providers, 
			   in which case ditch company board positions may be filled by municipal water providers.</p>			  
               <p>To divert water from a river into a ditch or canal for agricultural use (or urban use), diversion structures called headgates are installed 
               in the river.  Headgates are typically metal gates that are raised and lowered to allow a controlled amount of water to flow into a ditch or 
			   canal.  The amount of diverted water is measured and data are maintained by the <a href="http://water.state.co.us" target="_blank">Division of 
			   Water Resources<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>.  Ditches and canals often require a dam or inlet structure on the river to help push water into the ditch or canal.  Canals and ditches move 
			   diverted water using gravity; they often follow the topography of the land and may wind for many miles to their final point of delivery.  
			   At certain points along a ditch or canal, additional headgates release water into smaller ditches called laterals or else into pipelines 
			   (<a href="https://www.watereducationcolorado.org/news-and-publications/citizen-guides/citizens-guide-to-where-your-water-comes-from/" target="_blank">Citizen's

			   raw water to parks and natural areas.</p>
               <p>Most ditches in Colorado are owned by the water users themselves.  Small ditches are often owned in partnership by a handful of users. 
               Medium and large ditches are often owned by shareholders of mutual ditch companies, which are private, non-profit organizations formed 
               to distribute water to their member-owners.  Owners generally pay a fee to the ditch company based on the share of water that they own.

			  <h2>Changes in Agricultural Lands</h2>
			  <p>Agricultural land use has been changing over time for a number of reasons, including:</p>
			  <ul>
			    <li>Conversion from flood irrigation to sprinkler irrigation (see following section)</li>
				<li>Conversion of agricultural lands to urban areas</li>
				<li>Conversion of irrigated agricultural to non-agricultural or dryland farming because water 
				rights have been transferred off the land</li>
			  </ul>
			  <p>When agricultural lands are converted to urban use, the term "buy and dry" is often used.  This refers to a municipal water 
			  provider purchasing agricultural water rights and transferring the consumptive use portion of the right to municipal use.  
			  Quite often this process involves storing the water in a reservoir, and perhaps transitioning over time by using rental programs 
			  and other options to allow farming to continue.  Return flows must be maintained at historical averages as if the land were still 
			  in agricultural production.  Municipal entities typically don't need the water every year but are purchasing water to plan for 
			  growth and as an insurance policy against drought and climate change.</p>
			  <p>The image on the right shows how agricultural land use has changed over time at the boundary of irrigated agriculture and urban area, 
			  in this case near Greeley.  Click on the arrows in the middle of the image to move from an image from 2005 to one from 2017.  
			  Note the adoption of sprinkler irrigation over time and urban growth onto agricultural areas.  Whether the

			<p>The value of water is often quantified from the perspective of consumptive water uses such 
			as agriculture and municipal supply.  However, water that remains in a stream also has value for environmental and recreational 
			(E&R) uses, also sometimes called non-consumptive uses, although E&R uses do consume water such as through evaporation from water surfaces and 
			transpiration from vegetation.  The non-consumptive use of water provides benefits to fish, wildlife, riparian habitat, wetlands and 
			recreation.  These uses also have economic value and are some of the important qualities that people associate with Colorado.</p>
            <p>It is perhaps better to think of environmental entities as attributes rather than entities.  In the South Platte and Metro basins, these attributes include the 
			following (Basin Implementation Plan, p.2-25):</p>
               <ul>
                 <li style="text-align:left;">Rare aquatic-dependent plants</li>
                 <li style="text-align:left;">Significant riparian plant communities</li>
                 <li style="text-align:left;">Plains fish that are either state-endangered, threatened or species of special concern, such as:  Brassy Minnow, Common Shiner, Northern Redbelly Dace, Plains 
				 Minnow, Stonecat, Suckermouth Minnow, Iowa Darter and Plains Orangethroat Darter</li>
                 <li style="text-align:left;">State-endangered, threatened or species of special concern, such as:  Boreal Toad, Lake Chub, River Otter, Yellow Mud Turtle, Northern Leopard Frog, Northern

            <h2>Environmental Flow Protection</h2>			
			<p>The primary means of protecting environmental and recreational attributes is through the protection of flows.  A range of flows are 
			generally needed to protect aquatic species and their associated habitats.  For example, minimum flows are the minimum amounts of water needed to preserve the aquatic 
            environment, whereas peak flows can be cues for fish to spawn, flush sediment and deposit sediment to create new habitat.</p>			
			<p>The Colorado Water Conservation Board's <a href="http://cwcb.state.co.us/environment/instream-flow-program/Pages/main.aspx" 
			target="_blank">Instream Flow Program<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a> is tasked with the "appropriation, acquisition, protection and monitoring of instream flow and natural lake level water rights 
			to preserve and improve the natural environment to a reasonable degree".  This map shows CWCB decreed instream flow reaches in the South Platte and Metro basins.  
			Selecting a month on the right side of the map shows the decreed flow amounts for each month of the year.  Hover over a stream reach to obtain more information, 
			such as the number of miles of stream that are protected.</p>
			<p>Instream flow rights are often junior to water rights that provide water supply for agricultural and municipal uses and therefore streams with instream 
			flow rights can completely dry up.  In other cases, a senior water right lower in a basin can draw water through a reach and help provide instream flow.  The 
			nonprofit <a href="http://www.coloradowatertrust.org/" target="_blank">Colorado Water Trust<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a> is an organization that helps improve flow conditions 
			within the water rights system.</p>

            <h2>Industrial Entities</h2>
			<p>Industrial entities may also be large water users, especially in some areas.  Industries may receive water from utilities and other 
			water providers or may provide their own water as a "Self-Supplied Industry (SSI)".  Examples of industries that require water, 
			with potential data sources, include:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Dairy industry -- water is used directly and dairies also have large livestock feed inputs, with associated agricultural water demand.  
			A potential data source is <a href="https://www.dairymax.org/we-have-merged" target="_blank">Dairy MAX<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a> (formerly the Western Dairy 
			Association, which has merged with Texas-based Dairy MAX).</li>
			<li>Cattle industry and feedlots -- potential data sources are the <a href="https://www.coloradocattle.org/" target="_blank">Colorado Cattlemen's 
			Association<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a> and <a href="http://coloradolivestock.org/" target="_blank">Colorado Livestock Association<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>.</li>			
			<li>Brewing industry --  a common efficiency metric is gallons of water used per gallon of beer.  Potential data sources 
			are the <a href="https://www.brewersassociation.org/directories/breweries/" target="_blank">Brewers Association<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a>, <a href="https://coloradobeer.org"

			<li>Skiing industry (snowmaking) -- this use is generally non-consumptive, but water demand in the winter is at a time when streams have 
			low flows.</li>
			<li>Energy and mining (which includes aggregate) -- some companies hold large conditional water rights such as for oil shale development 
			that could have a major impact.</li>
			<li>Thermoelectric power generation -- water is used for cooling.</li>
			<li>Oil and Gas -- potential data source is the <a href="http://www.coga.org/" target="_blank">Colorado Oil and Gas Association.<img src="images/baseline_launch_black_18dp.png" width="12px"/></a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Increasing water use efficiency in industry can help reduce statewide water demand.  Reducing water input to industry also reduces 
			costs to the industry.</p>

			    <li style="text-align:left;">The content is best viewed on a relatively large display and has not been optimized for mobile devices</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">If content does not seem to fit in the browser window, use Ctrl - to reduce font sizes and Ctrl + to increase font sizes</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">For interactive maps, the default behavior for the mouse scroll is to advance the story page.  Click on the mouse 
				icon in the map to change mouse scrolling to zoom behavior.  Once changed, the behavior will apply only to the specific map</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">Interactive maps can be repositioned by holding the left mouse button and dragging the map</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">Scrollable text areas are provided in some pages and can be scrolled by dragging the scroll bar</li>

				<li style="text-align:left;">Links to external pages are generally the same font color as normal text but are indicated with underlines</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">Visualizations that will slow down the story are linked to as separate pages.  Mouse over the image to see 
				a popup link</li>
				<li style="text-align:left;">Interactive maps provide popups to view data.  If the popup flashes, drag the map to reposition it so that
